To be able to generate a strong NNUE network, Dog needs a large set of training data.
You can help generating that!
If you have docker installed on your computer, you can do the following:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/folkertvanheusden/Dog.git
	cd Dog
	./dockerrun

That's it! Interrupt the program whenever you like.
